# API Security Implementation with Message Boards

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing a secure RESTful API using Flask, with features including JWT-based authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and message boards for different user roles (Admin, Editor, User). The API ensures that only authorized users can access protected resources, providing a robust foundation for secure web applications. Additionally, the project includes a web interface where users can interact with the message boards according to their roles.

## Features

- **JWT Authentication:** Users can log in and receive a JWT token that is used to authenticate subsequent requests.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Users are assigned roles (Admin, Editor, User) that determine their access to certain API endpoints and message boards.
- **Protected Routes:** Only users with a valid JWT token and appropriate role can access certain API endpoints.
- **Environment Configuration:** Sensitive information, such as the secret key, is stored in environment variables.
- **Message Boards:** Separate message boards for Admin, Editor, and User roles, with different levels of access and functionality.
- **Session Management:** Secure session handling to maintain logged-in user states in the web interface.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **Virtualenv** (optional but recommended)
- **PostgreSQL** (as the database)

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neo050/APISecurityImplementation.git 
cd APISecurityImplementation
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

```bash
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://username:password@localhost/dbname
```

### Step 5: Run the Database Migrations

```bash
flask db upgrade
```

### Step 6: Run the Flask Application

```bash
python run.py
```

The application will start running at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

## Using the API

### 1. Obtain a JWT Token

To interact with the API, you must first obtain a JWT token by logging in:

- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/login`
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
      "user_id": "example_user",
      "password": "your_password"
  }
  ```
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
      "token": "your_jwt_token"
  }
  ```

Copy the token from the response. This will be used to authenticate requests to protected routes.

### 2. Access a Protected Route

Once you have the JWT token, you can access protected routes by including the token in the Authorization header:

- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/admin_board`
- **Headers:**
  ```
  Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token
  ```
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
      "messages": ["Message 1", "Message 2"]
  }
  ```

### 3. Example Requests Using Postman

**Login:**

- **Method:** POST
- **URL:** http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/login
- **Body (JSON):**
  ```json
  {
      "user_id": "example_user",
      "password": "your_password"
  }
  ```

**Access Protected Route:**

- **Method:** GET
- **URL:** http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/admin_board
- **Headers:**
  ```
  Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token
  ```

## Web Interface

- **Home Page:** Provides an overview and navigation to login, signup, and message boards.
- **Signup Page:** Allows users to create an account with username, email, password, and optional role.
- **Login Page:** Allows users to log in with their credentials.
- **Admin Board:** Accessible only by Admins to post and view messages.
- **Editor Board:** Accessible by Editors to post and view messages; Users can view but not post.
- **User Board:** Accessible by all roles to post and view messages.

## Security Measures

- **Password Hashing:** Passwords are securely hashed using a strong hashing algorithm.
- **Input Validation:** Protects against common security threats such as SQL injection and XSS.
- **Session Management:** Ensures secure handling of user sessions.
- **HTTPS:** Recommended for secure communication when deployed to a live environment.

## Deployment Considerations

- **Production-Ready Server:** Use a production-ready WSGI server such as Gunicorn for deployment.
- **Containerization:** Consider using Docker for containerization and easier deployment.
- **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to manage sensitive configuration such as database URLs and secret keys.
- **Database Setup:** Use Flask-Migrate and Alembic for database setup and migrations.

## Troubleshooting

- **Token is Invalid:** Ensure that the Authorization header is correctly formatted as `Bearer your_jwt_token` and that the token has not expired.
- **Token is Missing:** Make sure the Authorization header is included in the request when accessing protected routes.
- **Email Already Exists:** If you receive an error stating that the email is already in use, try registering with a different email address.

## Testing

- **API Testing:** Use Postman or a similar tool to test the API endpoints.
- **Unit and Integration Tests:** Ensure tests are written for critical components like authentication, RBAC, and message posting.

## Next Steps

- **Complete the Web Interface:** Ensure all web pages (signup, login, boards) are functional and integrated with the backend.
- **Security Review:** Conduct a security review to ensure all measures are properly implemented.
- **Deployment:** Prepare for deployment using a production server and possibly Docker.
